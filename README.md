# Chat Journal

## An app that allows you to literally talk to the wall!

**What will the application do?**
- Record your journals in the form of texts
- Make multiple chats for various journal categories

**Who will use it?**
- People who want to journal, but cannot commit to writing long structured paragraphs

**Why is this project of interest to you?**
- Journaling is good for reflection and letting out your emotions, but committing to it is difficult. I mostly reflect 
and let my thoughts out by talking to my best friend, but sometimes he can be pretty busy, so here's an app that has 
that rant format but nobody on the other side of the screen that would be bothered by it!
